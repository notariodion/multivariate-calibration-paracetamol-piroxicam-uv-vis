# Multivariate Calibration of UV-Vis Spectrophotometry for Detection of Paracetamol and Piroxicam in Herbal Medicine Mixtures

This repository contains R scripts for building multivariate calibration models using UV-Vis spectrophotometric data, aimed at detecting and quantifying **paracetamol** and **piroxicam** in herbal medicine mixtures.

## Background

The illegal addition of pharmaceutical active compounds (adulterants) in traditional herbal products remains a serious public health concern. Paracetamol and piroxicam are commonly misused due to their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. UV-Vis spectrophotometry combined with multivariate calibration techniques such as **Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)** allows simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple compounds in complex matrices like herbal preparations.

## Features

- Import and preprocessing of UV-Vis spectral data
- Exploratory data analysis and spectral visualization
- PLSR model building for paracetamol and piroxicam
- Model evaluation using RMSEP and cross-validation
- Automatic selection of optimal number of components based on minimum RMSEP
- Prediction of paracetamol and piroxicam concentrations in herbal samples
